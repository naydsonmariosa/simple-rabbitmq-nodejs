# Environment
I'm using Windows in this example, so I had to install [RabbitMQServer](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/download/v3.10.5/rabbitmq-server-3.10.5.exe)

# Running
Install dependencies

`npm install`

Go ahead and run index.js (as the worker) and receive.js (as the subscriber)
